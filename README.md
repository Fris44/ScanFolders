# ScanFolders
A crudely made program for creating folders for scanlation.
[Here's the link to the download (or go to the Releases tab)](https://github.com/TheFrisianGamer/ScanFolders/releases/latest)

## Features
1. Allows users to create folders for x amount of chapters, including split (currently only if all chapters are evenly split) and bonus chapters.
2. Allows users to create folders for specific scanlation roles per chapter.

## Requirements
The Windows version of this program requires the [.NET 7.0 Runtime.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
*Linux does not require anything, as it is built as a self-contained package (hence larger filesize)*

## Mac support
I don't have a Mac to test on, so if you can build and test releases, open an issue or send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheFrisianGamer)
[Here's extra info about publishing as an application bundle](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/distribution-publishing/macos)
