# ScanFolders
A crudely made for creating folders for scanlation.
[Here's the link to the download (or go to the Releases tab)](https://github.com/TheFrisianGamer/ScanFolders/releases/latest)

## Features
1. Allows users to create folders for x amount of chapters, including split (currently only if all chapters are evenly split) and bonus chapters.
2. Allows users to create folders for specific scanlation roles per chapter.

## Known issues
- Adding a slash in a folder name in the settings will create two folders. i.e. 08-TL/PR will create a folder called 08-TL with a folder called PR in it.
