# ScanFolders
GUI version of a personal program I made for creating folders for scanlation.
[Here's the link to the download (or go to the Releases tab)](https://github.com/TheFrisianGamer/ScanFolders/releases/latest)

## Features
1. Allows users to create folders for x amount of chapters, including split (currently only if all chapters are evenly split) and bonus chapters.
2. Allows users to create folders for specific scanlation roles per chapter.

## Requirements
[.NET 6.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
